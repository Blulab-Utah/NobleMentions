10001 EXAM: PA AND LATERAL CHEST, <DATE> FINDINGS: Compared to <DATE> and films dating back to <DATE> as well. Compared to most recent exam, the left lower lobe parenchymal changes seen behind the cardiac silhouette on PA film have resolved. There is some increased density not seen in the right peritracheal area not identified on prior study, may represent just overlapping shadows and slight rotation of the patient rather than a discrete right peritracheal inflammation. Also on lateral film on present exam, there is an ill-defined density overlying the upper aspect of the vertebral bodies, this is not seen on older films and may represent just overlapping shadows rather than further parenchymal density. The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum appear normal. IMPRESSION: 1) Resolution of prior left lower lobe infiltrate. 2) Ill-defined parenchymal indistinctness in the right peritracheal area probably representing overlapping shadows rather than new pneumonia. In addition, focal small density on lateral film overlying the vertebral bodies probably representing overlapping shadows rather than new focal pneumonia although the latter cannot be totally excluded. Recommend continued follow-up film. END OF IMPRESSION:

10002 PA AND LATERAL CHEST COMPARED TO <DATE>. INTERPRETATION: The cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged . There is redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature, perivascular haziness consistent with CFH. There is a patchy appearance of both lungs slightly nodular with chronic blunting of the right costophrenic angle. This most likely represent only CHF but a follow-up study after patient treatment is recommended in order to document clearing. There is no signs suggestive of superimposed pneumonia. IMPRESSION: Findings consistent with CHF. Cardiomegaly. Recommend follow-up chest x-ray after medical treatment to exclude underlying parenchymal lung abnormality. ALERT COMMENT: Radiology significant finding alert system has been activated. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10003 Examination: PA and lateral chest, <DATE>. Comparison: <DATE>. Findings: 
There is patchy diffuse consolidation throughout the entire left lung. In the 
right mid and lower lung, patchy consolidation is also present. These findings 
are compatible with multifocal pneumonia. Left hemidiaphragm is elevated with 
possible subpulmonic effusion. Heart is enlarged. Aorta is dilated and ectatic. 
No pneumothorax. Impression: 1. Multifocal pneumonia involving the entire left 
lung and right lower lobe. Probable subpulmonic effusion. 2. Cardiomegaly. Given 
the presence of cardiomegaly and patchy involvement of the bilateral lungs, 
congestive heart failure accompanying pneumonia is a consideration. Comment:

Interval weight gain since prior films, and the AP position, accentuate the heart size which is suspected to be borderline enlarged.. Increased lung markings are worse at the bases and probably represent chronic interstitial scarring. There could be an element of interstitial edema. There is no pleural effusion. IMPRESSION: Borderline cardiomegaly and abnormal interstitial pattern with basilar hypoaeration. No focal infiltrate is detected NOTE: THIS REPORT WAS GENERATED USING A VOICE RECOGNITION COMPUTER SOFTWARE. THEREFORE, IT MAY CONTAIN ERRORS INHERENT TO THIS TECHNOLOGY. FEEDBACK REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ERRORS WOULD BE APPRECIATED. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10006 TWO VIEW CHEST PA and lateral views are compared with <DATE>. There is a new right lower lobe infiltrate and perhaps also a small amount of infiltrate in the right middle lobe. Heart size remains normal and there is no evidence of CHF or pleural fluid. IMPRESSION: Acute infiltrate at the right base, consistent with pneumonia but clinical correlation is advised. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

POSITIVE ALERT: Radiology significant finding alert system has been activated. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10013 EXAMINATION: PA AND LATERAL CHEST. <DATE>. COMMENT: Films now submitted for radiology interpretation. FINDINGS: There is felt to be considerable clearing of a congestive heart failure pulmonary edema pattern since <DATE>. However, there is felt to be still some prominence of pulmonary vascularity as well as development of bilateral pleural effusions and probably increased streaky lung densities at the bases which could be from pneumonia or atelectasis. Suspect underlying COPD. Suggest follow-up films following treatment.

10014 PA AND LATERAL CHEST: The heart has a left-sided prominence although signs of left-sided heart failure are not seen at this time. There is also no pleural fluid and no evidence of acute pneumonic infiltrations. Bilateral apical pleural thickening. Calcification within the tortuous aortic arch and descending aorta. Moderate amount of osteoarthritic changes scattered throughout the dorsal spine. CONCLUSION: No acute pneumonic infiltrations, signs of heart failure or pleural fluid demonstrable. Atherosclerotic changes throughout the thoracic aorta and mild left-sided cardiac prominence.

10015 Examination: PA and lateral chest, <DATE>. Comparison: <DATE> When compared to the prior examinations from <DATE>, there persists fluffy patchy interstitial abnormality throughout both lungs. In this setting, there is more prominent consolidation in the left midlung. This area appears to have more dense consolidation than the prior two examinations. When compared to the prior examination from <DATE>, all of the fluffy areas of interstitial abnormality are new.

10031 PA AND LATERAL CHEST, compared to <DATE>. INTERPRETATION: The cardiac silhouette and mediastinum are stable. There is new blunting of the right costophrenic angle consistent with a small effusion. This patient has severe COPD changes. This might represent mild changes of CHF as there seems to be slight redistribution of the pulmonary vasculature. It is associated with some patchy area of the right lung base and some volume loss in the right lower lobe and middle lobe. Pneumonia can not be completely excluded at the right lung base and correlation with clinical findings recommended. IMPRESSION: New right-sided pleural effusion with some volume loss in the middle lobe and some patchy opacity at the right lung base. This most likely represent passive atelectasis but pneumonia cannot be excluded. In addition the patient has severe COPD changes in the might be some mild changes of CHF.

10036 Chest x-ray PA lateral chest: On lateral view, unusual appearance to the left diaphragm giving the impression of possible significant left lower lobe parenchymal abnormality versus chronic scarring and eventration of the diaphragm. Also unusual linear rounded density overlying the left lower lobe on PA view Remainder of the lungs are clear. Cardiac silhouette mediastinum are unremarkable Impression Without old films, difficult to determine if any of the findings in the left base are acute versus chronic. Differential includes chronic tenting of the diaphragm versus atelectasis left base. addendum will be reported when old films can be retrieved Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE> Addendum Begins ADDENDUM: Previous chest films are now available for review. There is a definite change in the appearance of the left diaphragm which is focally/centrally somewhat elevated with an indistinct margin. Suspect this is related to scarring or localized hernia. The questioned rounded density at the left base is suspected just the cardiac silhouette (there is cardiomegaly). Noncontrast CT scanning the chest would likely clarify this diaphragmatic change.

Previous studies and follow-up PA and lateral chest film is recommended for further evaluation of the more chronic nodular densities in the right midlung field. IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe infiltrate consistent with pneumonitis. Possible associated effusion. Right midlung field nodular densities for which follow-up exam is recommended. See above. Previous faint densities were described in the right midlung field on a routine chest film of <DATE>. Comparison will be necessary. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10065 Examination: PA and lateral chest, <DATE>. Comparison: <DATE> When compared to the upper examination, there is no significant change. As before, lungs are hyperinflated. Hemidiaphragms are flattened. There is atelectasis in the left lung base. Heart and mediastinum are stable. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Impression: Stable abnormal chest with underlying COPD. No acute abnormalities. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10066 Since <DATE> there has been interval development of a small area of infiltrate in the right lower lobe posteriorly consistent with a small area of pneumonia. There has been a previous right mastectomy and multiple sternal wires and mediastinal clips are present from previous surgery. There is chronic pleural thickening in the left hemithorax and the heart is prominent but there is no radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure. IMPRESSION: Interval appearance of a small right lower lobe infiltrate.

10067 EXAMINATION: CHEST FINDINGS: Reference to prior study 8 weeks ago. Further improvement has occurred in the posterior segment right upper lobe pneumonia, degree of infiltrate and degree of right hilar prominence both on the decrease. However, some infiltrate still persists and there is no question that atelectasis has occurred in the right upper lobe. Question would be, does the issue of atelectasis mandate any direct inspiration by Pulmonary Medicine? Left lung is clear. IMPRESSION: Improving chest, please see above commentary. END OF IMPRESSION:

10068 Examination: PA and lateral chest <DATE>. Comparison: <DATE>. When compared to the prior examination, there is increasing focal area of consolidation in the lower lobes bilaterally, right greater than left. This is more pronounced on the lateral view. This is in the setting of bilateral perihilar lymphadenopathy and multiple perihilar streaky and nodular consolidations. There is also underlying lung fibrosis. No pleural effusions bilaterally. Heart and mediastinum are stable. Impression: Increasing bilateral lower lobe consolidation, right greater than left, in this setting of cough and fever is worrisome for pneumonia. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and nodular and patchy consolidation are compatible with the underlying sarcoidosis. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10069 CHEST, two view: Comparison: <DATE> FINDINGS: There are patchy interstitial densities throughout both lungs. There is thickening along the lower right lateral chest wall and blunting of the left CP angle which is unchanged. There is thickening of the right apex unchanged. There is also slight blunting of the left CP angle. lungs are hyperexpanded. Density in the right infrahilar area is somewhat more prominent compared to November, but I think this is probably mostly due to rotation. There is moderately severe cardiomegaly with prominence of the left ventricle; left ventricle appears slightly more prominent compared to November. Central vessels appear prominent with some redistribution to the upper lungs. IMPRESSION: Findings are consistent with CHF. Blunting of both CP angles appears to be chronic, this may be a combination of pleural effusion and pleural scarring. Hyperexpansion consistent with COPD. Patient was treated for both CHF and COPD. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10070 HISTORY: Chest pain TECHNIQUE: PA and lateral chest, two views COMPARISON: <DATE> FINDINGS: The cardiac silhouette is normal. The lungs shows stable opacity in the right middle lobe, difficult to say with certainty where there it is acute or chronic. Mediastinal silhouette show stable postsurgical changes. Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits. The visualized bony structures show osteopenia. IMPRESSION: Stable chest.right mid lobe opacity is still present. Recommend continued follow-up with repeat radiographs in approximately 4 to six weeks. NOTE: THIS REPORT WAS GENERATED USING A VOICE RECOGNITION COMPUTER SOFTWARE. THEREFORE, IT MAY CONTAIN ERRORS INHERENT TO THIS TECHNOLOGY. FEEDBACK REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ERRORS WOULD BE APPRECIATED. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10071 Procedure: PA and lateral chest x-ray. Findings: Comparison with the prior chest x-ray examination dated <DATE> demonstrates new right lower lobe consolidation and atelectasis with mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. A small right pleural effusion may be present as well. This may represent pneumonia. Stable chronic fibrotic changes are present at the left lower lobe base. The heart size and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits. There is calcification aortic atherosclerosis. Impression: New right lower lobe basilar consolidation and atelectasis which may represent pneumonia. Follow-up evaluation is recommended. EPIC alert system was activated. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10072 COMPARISON: <DATE> FINDINGS: There is new opacity in the right lung base and. This has an interstitial appearance but is relatively focal, measuring roughly 15 mm. This likely represents a focal infiltrate. There also is mild interstitial opacity in the upper right lung consistent with infiltrate or atelectasis. The left lung is clear. There are no pleural effusions. The cardiac silhouette is normal. IMPRESSION: Opacities in the right lung most likely represent relatively focal infiltrate consistent with pneumonia. Follow-up chest radiograph in six weeks, after resolution of the current clinical symptoms, is strongly recommended. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10073 Two views of the chest Patient has a prominent thoracic kyphosis secondary to multiple compression fractures. There is tortuosity of the thoracic aorta. Increased density is seen at both lung bases. Some of this is chronic compared to <DATE>. However, the opacities appear somewhat more prominent and basilar infiltrate/atelectasis may be present. Impression: Increasing bibasilar infiltrate/atelectasis. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10074 PAL chest: <DATE> Findings: Since <DATE> the patient has developed patchy consolidation in the lingula of the left upper lobe seen both on the PA and lateral view very there is similar lesser change in the right lung base posteriorly. Note is spreading upon the vascular typical for COPD. Again noted is collapse of the opera thoracic vertebral body approximately T5. Impression: Patchy by basilar pneumonia ALERT COMMENT: Radiology significant finding alert system has been activated. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10075 PORTABLE CHEST ONE VIEW <DATE> Comparison: Men are available. Findings: Upright A.P. film was obtained at 1935 hours. Heart size is difficult to evaluate due to opacification of the left lower lobe due to a pleural effusion. There may also be an infiltrate extending from the hilum to this area. The pulmonary vessels do not appear significantly engorged as I would expect to see with heart failure as a cause of the effusion although there are some interstitial lines in the lung bases. There is atherosclerotic calcification in the aorta. Hilar structures are poorly visualized. Impression: Left lower lobe consolidation probably combination of infiltrate and pleural effusion. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10076 PA and lateral chest Cardiac and mediastinal shadows are normal. There is a prominent infiltrate involving the right middle lobe and right upper lobe. Impression: Right middle lobe and right upper lobe infiltrate. POSITIVE ALERT COMMENT: Radiology significant finding alert system has been activated. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10077 PAL chest: The <DATE> Findings: There are no previous studies available for comparison at this time. Findings: There is moderate cardiomegaly distention of the pulmonary vasculature, interstitial edema all typical for congestive heart failure. There are prominent bilateral pleural effusions greater the left in the right associated with this as well as atelectasis of much of the left lower lobe which could be secondary to the effusion or I suppose an associated pneumonia. Correlation for fever and WBC count is suggested. Impression: Cardiac decompensation and failure with bilateral pleural effusions and left lower lobe atelectasis and/or pneumonia. Findings reviewed with the urgent care medical service at the conclusion of the exam. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10078 CHEST ONE VIEW <DATE> COMPARISON: <DATE> FINDINGS: Semi upright A.P. film is obtained portably at 2145 hours. Increasing opacification is present in the left lower lobe. Infiltrate, pleural effusion and/or atelectasis must be considered. The bronchovascular markings are diffusely prominent throughout the remainder of the chest although this may be related to technique. Heart size is enlarged but stable.. . . IMPRESSION: Increasing opacification of left lower lobe. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10079 PA and lateral chest There are no recent prior examinations available for comparison. There is a cardiac pacemaker. There is mild infiltrate/ consolidation in the left upper lobe, a new finding since <DATE>. There is mild chronic platelike atelectasis or scar in the right lung. Impression: Left upper lobe consolidation. An attempt will be made to obtain Virginia Mason radiographs for comparison. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE> Addendum Begins Comparison examination from Virginia Mason dated <DATE> are reviewed on the Stentor. In the left upper lobe, there was dense consolidation on the previous examination performed at Virginia Mason. On today's examination, the consolidation has improved significantly. There persists linear scar like areas of abnormality which probably represents residuum of previous infection. There are no examination from the east side hospital which are more recent than the <DATE> films. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE> Addendum Ends

10080 EXAMINATIONS: RIGHT RIBS TWO VIEWS PA AND LATERAL CHEST <DATE> {Associated exams #***** and #*****} FINDINGS: Right ribs: No fractures are identified. PA and lateral chest: Comparison <DATE>. When compared to the previous examination, bilateral pneumonias have improved. There persists some consolidation in the right lung base. Heart is enlarged which is more prominent than the previous examination. Peribronchial cuffing. No convincing evidence for pulmonary edema. There is a suggestion of prominence in the right hilar region. Question right hilar mass. Recommend CT evaluation of the chest to exclude right hilar mass. DICTAPHONE POSITIVE ALERT REPORTING SYSTEM HAS BEEN ACTIVATED. END OF IMPRESSION:

10081 EXAMINATION: A.P. and lateral sitting chest films on <DATE>. COMPARISON: <DATE>. FINDINGS: There is evidence for previous mediastinal surgery. The heart size is not enlarged and there is no evidence for pulmonary venous hypertension. There is no evidence for mass or obvious consolidation, but there is slight increased density overlying the lower third of the thoracic spine which could represent some old scarring or minimal atelectasis are minimal acute infiltrate. There was some increased density overlying lower third thoracic spine on the previous lateral <DATE> so that some of density could represent scarring. Is no evidence for pleural effusion and mediastinal mass.. IMPRESSION: 1. Minor basilar pulmonary abnormalities of uncertain etiology. 2. There is no definite evidence for congestive heart failure this time.. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10082 Exam date: <DATE> AM Exam: AP chest History: F/U PNEUMONIA Comparison: Previous day Findings: Patchy right basilar opacity is less apparent, possibly representing gradual resolution. Pulmonary vascular distention has also decreased. There is still mild left basal atelectasis or scarring. Heart and mediastinum are stable. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10083 Two views of the chest No prior currently present for comparison. The exam is markedly abnormal manifested primarily as diffuse bilateral increased interstitial markings. Whether this is on an acute or chronic bases is not determined. Multiple potential etiologies. The heart does not appear obviously enlarged. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10084 EXAMINATION:Chest COMPARISON:none REASON:Shortness of breath, cough TECHNIQUE: Two views FINDINGS: Inspiration is limited. A large hiatal hernia is present. Blunting of the right costophrenic angle noted question right subpulmonic effusion. Question left perihilar infiltrate IMPRESSION: Question active parenchymal infiltrate and right subpulmonic effusion. Recommend comparison with prior films if available Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10085 CHEST: PA and lateral films. Patient has a minimal focus of infiltrate and or atelectasis in the right middle lobe. Left lung is clear. Heart size normal. There may be spillover of density into the right lower lobe as well. IMPRESSION: Right base infiltrate. Please obtain follow-up. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10086 EXAMINATION: Chest COMPARISON: <DATE> REASON: Dyspnea TECHNIQUE: Two views FINDINGS: Loss of definition of the left hemidiaphragm and left costophrenic angle noted. There is normal aeration of right hemithorax. Cardiomegaly seen. Kyphosis present. IMPRESSION: Left lower lobe consolidation and associated left effusion Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10087 FINDINGS: AP view of the chest was obtained. The interstitial markings are quite prominent diffusely. This likely is chronic in nature. Diffuse bronchiectasis was noted on a prior high-resolution chest CT. There are no definite air space infiltrates. However, an interstitial infiltrate would be impossible to exclude in this setting without prior films. There is no pleural effusion. The heart size is in the upper normal range. IMPRESSION: Diffuse prominent interstitial markings likely chronic in nature. Superimposed interstitial pneumonia cannot be excluded, however. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE> Addendum Begins Chest x-ray from <DATE> is not available for comparison. The prominent interstitial marking are more marked in the study dated <DATE> consistent with superimposed CHF especially in the upper lobes. The appearance of the lower lobes appears to be fairly chronic. No effusion. Impression The findings are consistent with mild to moderate interstitial edema superimposed with some chronic interstitial changes. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE> Addendum Ends

10088 EXAMINATION: AP upright portable chest on <DATE>. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: The patient has taken a rather poor inspiration similar to the previous exam on <DATE>. The heart is not significantly enlarged. I doubt significant pulmonary venous hypertension at this time. There is a small right pleural effusion but the right lung is otherwise clear. Again noted is considerable opacity at the left lung base with an air bronchogram present on the earlier exam and still probably present at this time. The appearance is consistent with pneumonia or distal airspace collapse from some atelectasis. There could be associated small left pleural effusion.. IMPRESSION: Persistent left lower lobe abnormality that could represent pneumonia and/or atelectasis. Doubt significant congestive heart failure at this time.. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10089 A.P. and lateral chest x-ray: Number of views: 2 NOTE: THIS REPORT WAS GENERATED USING A VOICE RECOGNITION COMPUTER SOFTWARE. THEREFORE, IT MAY CONTAIN ERRORS INHERENT TO THIS TECHNOLOGY. FEEDBACK REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ERRORS WOULD BE APPRECIATED. No prior films available for comparison at this time. Findings: Heart not enlarged, hilar structures are unremarkable. No pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema. Small area of increased density in the area of the left lateral costophrenic angle may at least in part be due to superimposition but might also represent a very small area of infiltrate or small zone of subsegmental atelectasis. Pleural effusion is considered less likely but is not excluded. No pleural fluid seen posteriorly to the right lung base. Multiple old healed rib fractures posteriorly on the left. Compression fractures in the thoracic spine is osteopenic patient. Correlate clinically. Impression: Small area of density in the area of the left lateral costophrenic angle of uncertain etiology. Could at least in part be due to superimposition of structures but, additional considerations would include small area of subsegmental atelectasis versus small infiltrate versus area of scarring. Correlate clinically. No evidence for CHF. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10090 PAL chest: <DATE> Findings: Since <DATE> the patient has developed patchy consolidation in the lingula of the left upper lobe seen both on the PA and lateral view very there is similar lesser change in the right lung base posteriorly. Note is spreading upon the vascular typical for COPD. Again noted is collapse of the opera thoracic vertebral body approximately T5. Impression: Patchy by basilar pneumonia ALERT COMMENT: Radiology significant finding alert system has been activated. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10091 Portable Chest Left pleural effusion. Probably small right pleural effusion. Diffuse increased interstitial markings and probably bronchovascular markings. This includes septal lines. The possibility of pulmonary interstitial edema is raised. It would be difficult to exclude infiltrate or other abnormal opacification in the left lower thorax. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10092 Chest PA and lateral <DATE> History: 71 year old male with cough and sputum production, history of COPD Comparison: <DATE> Findings: The heart size is again at the upper limits of normal. The aorta is unfolded. The pulmonary vascular markings are within normal limits. Air space disease is present in the lower lobes bilaterally. A small left pleural effusion is seen. Impression: Left lower lobe pneumonia. Right lower lobe atelectasis or pneumonia. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10093 EXAMINATION: CHEST, <DATE> CHEST, <DATE> CHEST COMPARISON/FINDINGS, <DATE>: Comparison is made to a earlier film of the same date, <TIME>. This examination was performed specifically to demonstrate the new PICC line introduced from the left arm, and its tip -- as best I can tell -- enters from the left arm, appears to course appropriate to be in the left superior vena cava, with its course superior to the aortic arch but ending projected over the trachea. I suspect this is probably into the superior vena cava on this AP film but it is hard to be entirely certain. It could still be just in the left subclavian vein, near the junction of the superior vena cava. Unfortunately, the patient was rotated slightly to the right. The endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position. The heart size is accentuated by the filming geometry, probably not significantly enlarged. Perihilar infiltrates are again noted, perhaps related to ARDS. IMPRESSION: PICC line entering from the left arm. The exact location of the tip cannot be precisely defined -- whether it is still in the left subclavian vein or whether it has actually reached the superior vena cava or whether it is a tributary to the left subclavian vein. END OF IMPRESSION: CHEST COMPARISON/FINDINGS, <DATE>: This exam was obtained at <TIME>, AP semiupright, and is compared to a similar film which was obtained supine at <DATE>. The endotracheal tube has been removed. The PICC line remains in unchanged position. The nasogastric tube is in place. Heart size appears to be slightly more prominent, with a suggestion of cardiomegaly. The perihilar infiltrates I think have probably decreased but are minimized in their radiographic appearance due to the overpenetrated technique. I suspect this represents some improvement in the patient's ARDS, but follow-up better-quality filming would be needed to confirm.

10094 EXAMINATION: Chest (two views), <DATE>. FINDINGS: Frontal view is obtained AP upright and a similar projection to the studies of <DATE>. Once again, the patient has taken a very poor inspiration. The patient has fairly marked kyphosis of the thoracic spine, which adds further difficulty in interpreting the film. I believe cardiomegaly is present, but I doubt pulmonary venous hypertension. There are basilar densities that mainly appear to be interstitial, more marked on the left than the right, but this is not a new finding; the pattern is more suggestive of scarring, although due to poor inspiration, some atelectasis may be contributing to it as well. I suspect the lungs may be somewhat hyperinflated as judged from the lateral view as there is marked increased anteroposterior dimension of the chest, but since the diaphragms are so high, overall lung volumes are not that increased. IMPRESSION: 1. No evidence for congestive heart failure. 2. Interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, mainly on the left, the appearance suggestive of some scarring or atelectasis rather than pneumonia. END OF IMPRESSION:

10095 TWO VIEW CHEST, <DATE> COMPARISON: <DATE> PA and lateral views demonstrate normal cardiomediastinal and hilar silhouettes. There is no evidence of CHF or pleural abnormality. Old right-sided posterior rib fracture deformities appears stable.. there are new bilateral areas of subsegmental atelectasis. IMPRESSION: New bilateral infiltrates, with mainly linear atelectatic components. This could represent atypical pneumonia. Clinical correlation and radiographic follow-up are recommended. ALERT COMMENT: RADIOLOGY SIGNIFICANT FINDING ALERT SYSTEM HAS BEEN ACTIVATED.. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10096 Chest x-ray PA lateral chest compare prior exam of <DATE> demonstrates rotation resulting in appearance of cardiomegaly but felt to be position. Slight indistinctness of the right lower lobe vascularity especially on lateral projection which may represent some volume loss/early pneumonitis right base. Minimal scarring left base. Cardiac silhouette appears grossly normal Impression Question pneumonitis/atelectasis right lower lobe. Doubt cardiomegaly Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10097 PA and lateral chest Patient status post sternotomy. Cardiac silhouette is at the upper limits of normal in size. There is a tortuous and prominent thoracic aorta, stable in appearance since <DATE>. There is an infiltrate at the right lung base, a new finding since the prior study. There are areas of platelike atelectasis at the lung bases as well. There are no pleural effusions. Impression: Right lung infiltrate. POSITIVE ALERT COMMENT: Radiology significant finding alert system has been activated. Signed by: <DOCTOR> Date: <DATE>

10098 EXAMINATION: CHEST CT SCAN WITHOUT CONTRAST, <DATE> COMPARISON: Correlated with a chest x-ray performed today, <DATE>, and compared to <DATE>. TECHNIQUE: Examination performed without oral or IV contrast. FINDINGS: On the chest x-ray, note should be made that the rounded opacities at the right lung base and the atelectasis at the left lung base have resolved. CT scan: The mediastinum is unremarkable. No significantly enlarged lymph node is visualized. In the lung parenchyma, very faint patchy opacities are visualized in the posterior segment of the left lower lobe and in the middle lobe. These have the appearance of resolving or mild air space disease. No predominant nodule or other finding noted. Portions of the upper abdomen visualized on this study are unremarkable. IMPRESSION: The radiographic findings on the chest x-ray have essentially completely resolved. This is correlated with the CT scan that has minimal faint and patchy area of residual air space disease consistent with resolving pneumonia. Therefore, this could be followed further if necessary by a plain chest x-ray. END OF IMPRESSION:

Compared to <DATE>, a diffuse opacification has appeared in the perihilar region on the left and on the lateral view, a pleural- based mass has appeared posteriorly. There is blunting of the left phrenic angle which is new. The right lung remains clear. The heart size has not changed and remains within normal limits. The transverse heart diameter measures 15 cm for a transverse chest diameter of 35.5 cm. The elongation, the configuration of the aorta, the appearance of the upper mediastinum and pulmonary vasculature is stable. Degenerative changes in the thoracic spine and calcification in the anterior longitudinal ligament also unchanged.
