Intern contacted family today to discuss veteran's care needs.  Tried to reach vets wife but phone number disconnected.  Contacted veteran's daughter who is also vet's POA.  Daughter stated she recently spoke to vets discharge nurse and was aware that veteran would need NH placement.  HPC SW intern discussed this with vet's daughter in more detail.  Vet's daughter stated that it would not be best for her father to come home.  Vet's wife (daughter's step-mother) recently had a stroke and is wheelchair bound and also needs caretaking.  Daughter is concerned that the needs in the home for both are too high and that it would be beneficial for both to begin looking at NH placement.  Daughter is aware after talking with medical team that vet is not doing very well.  Daughter understands that vet can go over to LD for up to 30 days while awaiting a NH placement.  Daughter will be visiting vet later today at CD to talk with him more about this.
